1. Average node degree: The degree of each node equals to lines connected to it. Average just means the average of the degree of all nodes.(2.33)
2. Diameter of the graph: The greatest distance between any pair of nodes.(10)
3. Average path length: Any pair of two nodes has graph-distance between them. The average means calculate the average graph-distance between all-pairs of nodes. (3.564)
